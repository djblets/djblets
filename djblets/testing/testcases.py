                Keys are destination attribute names, and values are the
                annotation instances.

                The default is empty.

            distinct (bool, optional):
                Whether :py:meth:`django.db.models.query.QuerySet.distinct`
                was used.

                The default is ``False``.

            distinct_fields (tuple of str, optional):
                A list of fields passed to
                :py:meth:`django.db.models.query.QuerySet.distinct`.

                The default is empty.

            extra (dict, optional):
                State passed in calls to
                :py:meth:`django.db.models.query.QuerySet.extra` when using
                ``select`` and ``select_params``.

                Each key maps to a key in ``select``, and each value is a
                tuple containing the value in ``select`` and the corresponding
                value (if any) in ``select_params``.

                Values are normalized to collapse and strip whitespace, to
                help with comparison.

                The default is empty.

            extra_order_by (list of str, optional):
                State passed in calls to
                :py:meth:`django.db.models.query.QuerySet.extra` when using
                ``order_by``.

                ``tables``.

                The default is empty.

            group_by (bool or tuple, optional):
                Whether no fields will be grouped (``None``), all fields will
                be grouped (``True``), or specific expressions/field names are
                grouped (a tuple).

                This is influenced by using
                :py:meth:`django.db.models.query.QuerySet.annotate`.

                The default is ``None``.

            limit (int, optional):
                The value for a ``LIMIT`` in the ``SELECT``.

                This will generally only need to be supplied if testing a
                query using :py:meth:`QuerySet.exists()
                <django.db.models.query.QuerySet.exists>` or when slicing
                results.

                Django itself sometimes uses a default of ``None`` and
                sometimes a default currently of ``21`` (this exact value,
                and when it's used, is considered an implementation detail
                in Django). Both of these will match a caller-provided
                ``limit`` value of ``None``.

                The default is ``None``.

            num_joins (int, optional):
                The number of tables JOINed.

                The default is 0.

            offset (int, optional):
                The value for an ``OFFSET`` in the ``SELECT``.

                The default is 0.

            only_fields (set of str, optional);
                The specific fields being fetched, or ``None`` if fetching
                all fields.

                The default is ``None``.

            order_by (tuple of str, optional):
                The ordering criteria.

                The default is empty.

            select_for_update (bool, optional):
                Whether this is a select-for-update operation.

                The default is ``False``.

            select_related (set of str, optional):
                The table names involved in a
                :py:meth:`django.db.models.query.QuerySet.select_related`.

                Whether this is considered a subquery of another query.

                The default is ``False``.

            tables (set of str, optional):
                The tables involved in the query.

                The default is the model's table name.

            type (str, optional):
                The query type. This would be one of ``DELETE``, ``INSERT``,
                ``SELECT``, or ``UPDATE``.

                The default is ``SELECT``.

            values_select (list of str, optional):

    Unlike Django's standard fixture support, this doesn't re-discover
    and re-deserialize the referenced fixtures every time they're needed.
    Instead, it precompiles the fixtures the first time they're found and
    reuses their objects for future tests.

    However, also unlike Django's, this does not accept compressed or
    non-JSON fixtures.

    """Base class for an integration.

    Integrations are pluggable components that interface the application with
    a third-party service, notifying the service or triggering actions on
    certain events, or fetching data from the service. They can be registered
    by the consuming application or through extensions.

    Unlike an extension, an integration can contain multiple configurations
    active at one time. An example would be when you want multiple, distinct
    configurations for posting messages to different channels on a chat
    service.

    There's one Integration instance for each class, and it typically operates
    by responding to events and communicating with another service, making use
    of the state stored in one or more
    :py:class:`~djblets.integrations.models.BaseIntegrationConfig` instances,
    which it can query. This allows hook registration and other logic to be
    shared across all configurations of an instance.

    Integrations can make use of extension hooks, binding the lifecycle of that
    hook's registration to the lifecycle of that particular integration, making
    it very easy to tie an integration into any part of the application.

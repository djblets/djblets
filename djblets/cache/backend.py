    # encrypt. We want to encrypt iteratively, and we don't want to have
    # to load the entire results of the generator into memory at once.
    #
    # So we have to feed the first index of each tuple iteratively into
    # aes_encrypt_iter as a generator, but we also want to retain the other
    # data in each tuple and yield it along with the encrypted results.
    #
    # There isn't a one-to-one mapping between what goes in and what comes

    #
    # 1. We feed data into aes_encrypt_iter(), and keep a queue of the item
    #    data (has_item and item).
    #
    # 2. As we receive results, we pull off the front of the queue and yield
    #    it along with the data.
    #
    #    We then go through anything else in the queue (one item coming
    #    in could result in multiple coming out). Those yield those
    #    values, but without any data scheduled for storage, just scheduled
    #    to yield as results.
    #
    # 3. If there was nothing in the queue when we get data, then yield the
    #    data but with has_item=False, so it'll be stored but not yielded as
    #    results.

    The cache key will be prefixed by the site's domain, and will be
    changed to an SHA256 hash if it's larger than the maximum key size or
    contains characters not compatible with the cache backend.

    Version Changed:
        3.0:
        * Added support for encrypting keys through the
          ``use_encryption`` and ``encryption_key`` arguments.
        * Changed the hash format for keys to use SHA256 instead of MD5.
          This will invalidate all old keys in cache, but reduces chances
          of collision.
        * Keys will automatically use the hash format if they contain
          characters unsupported by the cache backend.
        * The return type is now :py:class:`str`, to generate keys that are
          more suitable for modern versions of Django.

    Args:
        key (str):
            The base key to generate a cache key from.

        use_encryption (bool, optional):
            Whether to generate an encrypted key.

            This will generate a HMAC digest of the key. There will be no
            identifying information in the resulting key.

            This defaults to ``False``, but can be forced on for all cached
            data by setting ``settings.DJBLETS_CACHE_FORCE_ENCRYPTION=True``.

            Version Added:
                3.0

        encryption_key (bytes, optional):
            An explicit AES encryption key to use when passing
            ``use_encryption=True``.

            This defaults the value in
            ``settings.DJBLETS_CACHE_DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY``, if set, or to

/**
 * Base class for hooks that an extension can use to augment functionality.
 *
 * Each type of hook represents a point in the codebase that an extension
 * is able to plug functionality into.
 *
 * Subclasses are expected to set a hookPoint field in the prototype to an
 * instance of ExtensionPoint.
 *
 * Instances of an ExtensionHook subclass that extensions create will be
 * automatically registered with both the extension and the list of hooks
 * for that ExtensionHook subclass.
 *
 * Callers that use ExtensionHook subclasses to provide functionality can
 * use the subclass's each() method to loop over all registered hooks.

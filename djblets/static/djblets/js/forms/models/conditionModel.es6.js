/**
 * A configured condition in a set.
 *
 * The condition represents a combination of a choice, operator, and value.
 * It's owned by a :js:class:`Djblets.Forms.ConditionSet`.
 *
 * Model Attributes:
 *     choice (Djblets.Forms.ConditionChoice):
 *         The selected choice for the condition.
 *
 *     error (string):
 *         An error message for this condition. This would be set if the
 *         user had invalid or missing data, submitted the form, and was
 *         then presented with a validation error.
 *
 *     operator (Djblets.Forms.ConditionOperator):
 *         The selected operator for the condition.
 *
 *     valid (boolean):
 *         Whether this condition is valid. A valid condition is one that
 *         could be loaded successfully (its choice and operator were
 *         registered). An invalid one is intended to be presented as-is,
 *         so the user can figure out what state things were in.
 *
 *     value (object):
 *         The value for the choice, or ``null`` if unset.

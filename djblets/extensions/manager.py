    ExtensionManager manages the extensions available to a project. It can

    An installed extension is one that has been installed by a Python package
    on the system.

    A registered extension is one that has been installed and information then
    placed in the database. This happens automatically after scanning for
    an installed extension. The registration data stores whether or not it's
    enabled, and stores various pieces of information on the extension.

    An enabled extension is one that is actively enabled and hooked into the
    project.

    Each project should have one ExtensionManager.

    Projects can set ``settings.EXTENSIONS_ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT`` to a list of
    extension IDs (class names) that should be automatically enabled when their
    registrations are first created. This will ensure that those extensions
    will default to being enabled. If an administrator later disables the
    extension, it won't automatically re-renable unless the registration is
    removed.

    attribute naming its JavaScript counterpart. This would be the variable
    name for the (uninitialized) model for the extension, defined in a
    JavaScript bundle.

    It may also define :py:attr:`apply_to`, which is a list of URL names that
    the extension will be initialized on. If not provided, the extension will
    be initialized on all pages.

    To provide additional data to the model instance, the JSExtension subclass
    can implement :py:meth:`get_model_data` and return a dictionary of data
    to pass. You may also override the :py:meth`get_settings` method to return,
    a dict of settings to the :py:class:`model_class`. By default, the

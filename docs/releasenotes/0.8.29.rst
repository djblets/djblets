============================
Djblets 0.8.29 Release Notes
============================

**Release date**: February 15, 2017


djblets.configforms
===================

* Fixed a bug where :py:class:`djblets.configforms.forms.ConfigPageForm`
  would always render, even if set to be invisible.


djblets.log
===========

* Fixed support for ``request=`` arguments to custom loggers.

* Patched :py:func:`logging.exception` to accept keyword arguments on older
  versions of Python. (:bug:`4523`)

  Python 2.6.x, 2.7.0 through 2.7.5, 3.0.x, and 3.1.x all had a bug where
  :py:func:`logging.exception` wouldn't accept keyword arguments, which is
  required for ``request=`` or ``extra=`` keyword arguments.


djblets.testing
===============

* Fixed a regression where :py:class:`djblets.testing.testrunners.TestRunner`
  could end up running the entire test suite when trying to run only
  specific tests.

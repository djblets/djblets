===========================
Djblets 1.0.4 Release Notes
===========================

**Release date**: March 19, 2018


Packaging
=========

* django-pipeline_ 1.6.14 is now the minimum required version.

* The package can no longer be installed on Python 2.6 or on 3.x.

  Djblets 2.0 will support Python 3.x, and will be coming later this year.


.. _django-pipeline: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-pipeline


djblets.configforms
===================

* :py:attr:`ConfigPageForm.profile
  <djblets.configforms.forms.ConfigPageForm.profile>` is now deprecated.

  Subclasses that want this should set it explicitly if needed.


djblets.datagrid
================

* Column rendering is now more careful to ensure labels are HTML-safe.

  This is not a security issue, as user-provided labels are not allowed,
  but it does prevent having to work around the issue when crafting labels
  using HTML-unsafe characters or when localizing content.


djblets.db
==========

* Fixed deadlock issues with
  :py:class:`~djblets.db.fields.relation_counter_field.RelationCounterField`.

* Fixed
  :py:class:`~djblets.db.fields.relation_counter_field.RelationCounterField`
  not updating counters on all instances of the same model.

* Fixed a problem tracking instances that could evaluate to ``False`` in
  :py:class:`~djblets.db.fields.relation_counter_field.RelationCounterField`.

  This would impact instances that defined a ``__len__`` or ``__nonzero__``
  and could result in ``bool(instance)`` returning ``False``.

* Split :py:mod:`djblets.db.fields` into submodules.

  Imports from :py:mod:`djblets.db.fields` will still work as they always
  have, but imports can also be made from the specific submodules.

* Added bullet-proofing of values going into
  :py:class:`~djblets.db.fields.base64_field.Base64Field`.


djblets.webapi
==============

* Improved performance of :py:func:`@webapi_request_fields
  <djblets.webapi.decorators.webapi_request_fields>`.


JavaScript
==========

* Added :js:func:`Djblets.parseQueryString` for parsing query strings in
  URLs.

* Added :js:func:`Djblets.buildURL` for building URLs based on a path,
  query string data, and anchors.

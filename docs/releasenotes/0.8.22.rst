============================
Djblets 0.8.22 Release Notes
============================

**Release date**: September 13, 2015


djblets.configforms
===================

The JavaScript side of the Config Forms support has gained a number of
additions to help with extensibility:

* Added events when showing/hiding action menus.

  :js:class:`Djblets.Config.ListItemView` now triggers ``actionMenuPopUp``
  and ``actionMenuPopDown`` events when showing or hiding action menus.

* Added class names for each row in a :js:class:`Djblets.Config.ListView`.

  The rows for each action in a menu now have a class name corresponding to
  the action ID, to improve styling. The padding around the menu has also
  changed to be more consistent, so that, for example, an action can have a
  suitable border separating it and other actions.

* Improved the display logic for action menus.

  Action menus no longer assumes the actions can fit on-screen when
  positioning the menu to align with the left of the action button. Instead,
  if there's not enough room, the menu will be positioned to align with the
  right of the button.

* Added property-based enabling/disabling of action.

  Action items in the menu can now be enabled/disabled based on a given
  property. This is helpful for having one action affect others, or to limit
  which actions can be toggled based on other computed state.


djblets.extensions
==================

* Added an ``install-extension-media`` management command for installing
  extension media.

  This will install the extension media for a site for all enabled
  extensions, or for the given extension ID (when using
  :option:`--extension-id`).


djblets.testing
===============

* Added a specialized version of :py:func:`assertRaisesMessage` that works
  with Python 2.7.10.

  Python 2.7.10 broke Django's :py:func:`assertRaisesMessage`. We've worked
  around this to ensure any unit tests using
  :py:class:`~djblets.testing.testcases.TestCase` can use this function
  without problems.

Djblets 0.8.27 Release Notes
============================

**Release date**: October 17, 2016


Upgrade Instructions
====================

To upgrade to Djblets 0.8.27, run::

    pip install Djblets==0.8.27

or::

    easy_install Djblets==0.8.27


djblets.configforms
===================

* Fixed passing JavaScript model data to the configuration forms.

* Fixed missing end tags in the configuration forms.


djblets.extensions
==================

* Added infrastructure to help test extensions.

  This allows projects to provide an easy way for extension authors to
  maintain test suites for their extensions, and offers utilities for
  extension authors themselves.

  See `Testing Extensions`_ for more information. Please note that these
  docs are written for Djblets 0.9, but still generally apply to this
  release.

* Updated :py:class:`~djblets.extensions.extension.ExtensionInfo` to work
  either with or without entrypoints.

  This class, which is used to store metadata information on an extension,
  used to require that the extension be backed by an entrypoint, which made
  it difficult to test. These are now able to be created and populated
  manually.

* Added better error reporting when failing to look up static media files
  in an extension during packaging.

* Exception tracebacks are now logged when an extension fails to load.

djblets.siteconfig
==================

* Fixed showing non-field error messages in the siteconfig settings page.

  The wrong variable was being accessed, preventing these errors from
  appearing.

* Added a template for rendering fieldsets for forms.

  The template logic for rendering fieldsets for siteconfig (or most standard
  forms) has been made available in the ``siteconfig/settings_fieldsets.html``
  template. This may be useful to templates that need to do something a bit
  custom.

  If using Djblets 0.9+, you will want to instead use
  ``forms/admin/form_fieldsets.html``, as the siteconfig templates are
  considered deprecated in newer versions.

* Added support for standard Django fieldset definitions in siteconfig
  settings forms.

  The old form required the use of a custom, legacy format for fieldset
  definitions in ``my_form_cls.Meta.fieldsets``. The new template supports
  the standard format that Django documents for forms.

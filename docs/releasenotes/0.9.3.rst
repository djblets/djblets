===========================
Djblets 0.9.3 Release Notes
===========================

**Release date**: April 13, 2016


djblets.configforms
===================

* Fixed problems with the model data payload outputted to the page when
  rendering config forms.

* Removing an item from a :js:class:`Djblets.Config.ListItemView` no longer
  removes an additional item as well.

* Fixed completely emptying a list of items when resetting a
  :js:class:`Djblets.Config.ListView`.


djblets.extensions
==================

* Added support for extensions bundled in Python Wheel packages.

  Our extension support now looks for :file:`METADATA` files in the Wheel
  packages, allowing them to be used instead of eggs.

* Added support for parsing multi-line descriptions in a package's
  :file:`PKG-INFO` or :file:`METADATA` file. (:bug:`4196`)

  Patch by Horatiu Eugen Vlad

* Allowed for specifying a specific default static media bundle to load when
  calling ``{% load_extensions_css %}`` or ``{% load_extensions_js %}``.

  This is taken as another parameter to these tags. The bundle will be
  loaded instead of the "default" bundle.

* Static media bundles can now include other bundles.

  This is specified by providing an ``include_bundles`` list in the bundle
  information. Note that this does not handle nesting of included bundles.
  Only the bundle being loaded can include other bundles.


djblets.webapi
==============

* Added warning-level logging for permission denied errors hit by a user.
  (:bug:`3108`)

  This allows for auditing when users are attempting to access resources they
  shouldn't.


JavaScript
==========

* Fixed a failure when logging other failures in
  :js:func:`Djblets.getGravatarForDisplay`.

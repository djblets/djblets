============================
Djblets 0.8.14 Release Notes
============================

**Release date**: January 6, 2015


djblets.cache
=============

.. py:currentmodule:: djblets.cache.forwarding_backend

* Fixed threading issues with :py:class:`ForwardingCacheBackend`.

  In a multi-threaded environment, a thread could end up resetting the
  forwarded cache backend while another was attempting to access it, causing
  a conflict. This could result in incorrect data being returned, or a crash
  to occur, when load is heavy.

  We now have several safeguards to prevent problems in this situation.


djblets.datagrid
================

.. py:currentmodule:: djblets.datagrid.grids

* Added support for datagrids with alphanumeric pagination.

  A new :py:class:`AlphanumericDatagrid` class has been added that uses
  an alphanumeric paginator. This allows for paginating by letters and
  numbers, instead of simply page numbers. That's useful when paginating
  lists of users, for example.

  Patch by Ryan Done.

* Added sandboxing for the :py:class:`Column` subclasses.

  :py:meth:`Column.render_data`, :py:meth:`Column.render_cell`,
  :py:meth:`Column.setup_state`, :py:meth:`Column.get_sort_field`, and
  :py:meth:`Column.augment_queryset` are now sandboxed, preventing any
  exceptions thrown within the methods from breaking the page. The
  exceptions will be captured and logged.

  Patch by Justin Maillet.


djblets.db
==========

.. py:currentmodule:: djblets.extensions.hooks.fields

* :py:class:`RelationCounterField` now has a default value for
  ``rel_field_name``, allowing it to be used in a database evolution.

  Patch by Beth Rennie.


djblets.extensions
==================

.. py:currentmodule:: djblets.extensions.hooks

* The extension instance is now passed to signal callback handlers when
  using :py:class:`SignalHook`.

  This instance is passed as an ``extension`` keyword argument to the
  handler function.

* Added sandboxing for :py:class:`SignalHook`.

  Signal callback functions attached via a :py:class:`SignalHook` can now
  optionally be sandboxed, preventing any exceptions thrown within the
  callback from breaking the code emitting the signal. The exceptions will
  be captured and logged.

  This is the default behavior, but that behavior can be overridden by passing
  ``sandbox_errors=False``.

  Patch by Justin Maillet.

* Added sandboxing for :py:class:`TemplateHook`.

  :py:meth:`TemplateHook.applies_to` is now sandboxed, preventing any
  exceptions from breaking the page. They will instead be captured and logged.

  Patch by Justin Maillet.


djblets.urls.resolvers
======================

.. py:currentmodule:: djblets.urls.resolvers

* Fixed threading issues with :py:class:`DynamicURLResolver`.

  There were some occasional breakages that could happen in a
  multi-threaded environment that would break URL lookups on the root
  URL resolver, or in any child resolver.

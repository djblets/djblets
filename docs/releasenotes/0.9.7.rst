Djblets 0.9.7 Release Notes
===========================

**Release date**: May 25, 2017


Packaging
=========

* Added a :command:`setup.py list_node_deps` command for outputting the
  contents for :file:`package.json`.

  This can be used to generate a npm :file:`package.json` that installs all
  the node.js dependencies needed by Djblets. It's intended for use by
  packagers.


General
=======

* Updated all the logging statements to use per-module logger names.

  This will help with identifying which part of Djblets a log statement
  applies to.


djblets.datagrid
================

* Fixed a performance issue in datagrids when using chained
  :py:meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.select_related` calls.

  In Django 1.6, these calls do not normally chain, and this affected the
  performance in datagrids when using columns that attempted to select
  related fields. Now they can chain without impacting the performance of
  other columns.


djblets.db.query
================

* Added :py:func:`~djblets.db.query.chainable_select_related_queryset` for
  chaining :py:meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.select_related` calls
  on Django 1.6.


djblets.extensions
==================

* Failing to install extension media files no longer results in crashes.

  Now, the failure is logged and can be dealt with. While pages may break due
  to lack of appropriate media files, but site itself will not crash.


JavaScript
==========

* Updated :js:func:`$.fn.proxyTouchEvents` to better simulate
  mouseover/mouseout events.

  This improves touch support for applications, and fixes resizing when using
  jQuery-UI's :js:func:`$.fn.resizable` widget.

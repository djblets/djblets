===========================
Djblets 0.9.4 Release Notes
===========================

**Release date**: October 17, 2016


djblets.configforms
===================

* Fixed passing JavaScript model data to the configuration forms.

* Fixed missing end tags in the configuration forms.


djblets.datagrid
================

* Added signals and attributes to the ``$.fn.datagrid`` widget for mobile
  mode.

  The datagrid widget now triggers ``datagridDisplayModeChanged`` events
  when going in and out of mobile mode. These provide a ``mode`` parameter
  indicating if it's in ``mobile`` or ``desktop`` modes. Callers can also
  look up the ``data-datagrid-display-mode`` attribute on the element to
  see what the current mode is at any time.

* Fixed a breakage in the columns menu when attempting to toggle it opened
  and closed really fast.


djblets.extensions
==================

* Added infrastructure to help test extensions.

  This allows projects to provide an easy way for extension authors to
  maintain test suites for their extensions, and offers utilities for
  extension authors themselves.

  See :ref:`testing-extensions` for more information.

* Updated :py:class:`~djblets.extensions.extension.ExtensionInfo` to work
  either with or without entrypoints.

  This class, which is used to store metadata information on an extension,
  used to require that the extension be backed by an entrypoint, which made
  it difficult to test. These are now able to be created and populated
  manually.

* Added better error reporting when failing to look up static media files
  in an extension during packaging.

* Exception tracebacks are now logged when an extension fails to load.


djblets.mail
============

* Added functionality for looking up DMARC_ records for a domain.

  The methods in :py:mod:`djblets.mail.dmarc` make it easy to look up
  the DMARC policies set for unverified senders, allowing for more
  intelligent decision making when preparing to send an e-mail on behalf
  of a user.

* Added optional smart spoofing of e-mail addresses in
  :py:class:`~djblets.mail.message.EmailMessage`.

  Projects can enable smart spoofing of sender e-mail addresses, which will
  choose a suitable :mailheader:`From` address based on whether a DMARC
  record could get in the way of an e-mail with a spoofed sender from being
  received by other users. See the documentation for
  :py:class:`~djblets.mail.message.EmailMessage` for information on how to
  enable this.

* Added support for setting BCC addresses in
  :py:class:`~djblets.mail.message.EmailMessage`.

* Made most of the options to :py:class:`~djblets.mail.message.EmailMessage`
  optional.

* Added utility functions for buliding e-mail addresses.

  The new methods in :py:mod:`djblets.mail.utils` can be used to properly
  format e-mail addresses, given a
  :py:class:`~django.contrib.auth.models.User` or a user's information.

djblets.siteconfig
==================

* Fixed showing non-field error messages in the siteconfig settings page.

  The wrong variable was being accessed, preventing these errors from
  appearing.


djblets.urls
============

* Added a function for lazily looking up a static media URL.

  The new :py:func:`~djblets.urls.staticfiles.static_lazy` can be used in
  a class body or global variable to reference a static media path without
  triggering an immediate lookup. The result will be resolved on demand when
  accessed by running code.


djblets.webapi
==============

* Removed references to "local sites" when generating API tokens.

  Local sites are a Review Board concept, which was accidentally brought
  over when API Token support was moved into Djblets.

* Floating point values are now serialized without crashing when using an XML
  response payload.

  Patch by Griffin Myers.

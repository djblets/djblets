Djblets 0.8.26 Release Notes
============================

**Release date**: April 13, 2016


Upgrade Instructions
====================

To upgrade to Djblets 0.8.26, run::

    pip install Djblets==0.8.26

or::

    easy_install Djblets==0.8.26


djblets.configforms
===================

* Fixed problems with the model data payload outputted to the page when
  rendering config forms.


djblets.extensions
==================

* Added support for extensions bundled in Python Wheel packages.

  Our extension support now looks for :file:`METADATA` files in the Wheel
  packages, allowing them to be used instead of eggs.

* Added support for parsing multi-line descriptions in a package's
  :file:`PKG-INFO` or :file:`METADATA` file. (:bug:`4196`)

  Patch by Horatiu Eugen Vlad

* Allowed for specifying a specific default static media bundle to load when
  calling ``{% load_extensions_css %}`` or ``{% load_extensions_js %}``.

  This is taken as another parameter to these tags. The bundle will be
  loaded instead of the "default" bundle.

* Static media bundles can now include other bundles.

  This is specified by providing an ``include_bundles`` list in the bundle
  information. Note that this does not handle nesting of included bundles.
  Only the bundle being loaded can include other bundles.

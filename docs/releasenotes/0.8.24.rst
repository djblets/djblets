============================
Djblets 0.8.24 Release Notes
============================

**Release date**: February 21, 2016


Compatibility
=============

If you use django-storages_, make sure you're using a recent version (we
recommend 1.1.8 or newer), as this release exposes a bug in earlier releases.

.. _django-storages: https://django-storages.readthedocs.org/en/latest/


djblets.datagrid
================

* Fix errors with datagrid sorting with trailing commas.

  Some search crawlers such as Bingbot can attempt to load a datagrid with a
  sort column list that had a trailing comma, causing a crash. This now filters
  out any invalid column names.


djblets.extensions
==================

* Added the ability to set custom settings data for JavaScript extensions.

  JavaScript extensions (those using
  :py:class:`~djblets.extensions.extension.JSExtension`) used to output all
  of an extension's stored settings into the page. Extensions that want to
  limit that data, or provide a custom set of extension settings data, can
  override this using :py:meth:`JSExtension.get_settings
  <djblets.extensions.extension.JSExtension.get_settings>`.


djblets.urls
============

* Sped up the clearing of URL caches in
  :py:class:`~djblets.urls.resolvers.DynamicURLResolver`.


djblets.util
============

* Simplified generation of thumbnails and image crops, leading to
  performance gains.

* :py:func:`~djblets.util.decorators.simple_decorator` and
  :py:func:`~djblets.util.decorators.basictag` now properly set
  ``__module__``.

djblets.forms
=============

* Fixed a client-side regression for related object selectors.

  Djblets provides a form field to provide related object selection (i.e. for
  use in Django admin sites) that is based on search capabilities rather than
  large database queries. Djblets 5.2 had a regression where the JavaScript
  side of this could raise errors, breaking the form.

* Improved the look of the delete icon in related object selectors.

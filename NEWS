version 0.5 rc2 (13-June-2009):
	* General:
		* Properly list the license as MIT, not GPL, in setup.py.
		  (Bug #1120)

	* JavaScript:
		* Prevent funcQueue.start() from being called when the queue is
		  already started.

	* djblets.datagrid:
		* Added speedups when sorting columns. We used to generate an SQL
		  query that pulled in all information in the order specified by
		  the columns, but this could be slow for large data sets. We now
		  do the minimal query, retrieving only the object IDs, and then
		  fetch data on those specific IDs in a second query. The end result
		  is a significant speedup in rendering datagrids when used with
		  large amounts of data.

	* djblets.log:
		* Fix logging when we're unable to write to the log file. We now
		  fall back on stderr. Patch by Paolo Borelli.

	* djblets.util.fields:
		* Fixed a typo in a variable name that caused problems in JSONField
		  when getting data in an unexpected format.


version 0.5 rc1 (3-May-2009):
	* JavaScript:
		* Clicking the edit icons for inlineEditors no longer causes the
		  page to scroll in some browsers. (Bug #1057)

	* djblets.datagrids:
		* Sped up the datagrids in some cases by always including related
		  objects (up to one depth level) in the query for the datagrid.

	* djblets.siteconfig:
		* Prepended the site's domain to the siteconfig cache key, making it
		  possible to use multiple siteconfig-based apps on the same server.
		  (Bug #986)

		* Saving a SiteConfig didn't always cause other instances of that
		  SiteConfig on the server to reload, meaning that people would
		  sometimes have to restart the server to get settings to apply.
		  This is now fixed.
		  (Bug #734)

		* Removed a redundant key for the timezone.

	* djblets.util.templatetags.djblets_utils:
		* The ageid filter now returns an empty string if passed 'None' as
		  the timestamp.


version 0.5 beta 1 (28-March-2009):
	* JavaScript:
		* Moved to using jQuery 1.3.2.

		* Small performance improvements in tooltip and modalBox.

		* The edit icons in an inlineEditor are now accessible, so they can
		  be activated by pressing the Enter key in Firefox. Patch by
		  Brad Taylor. (Bug #965)

	* djblets.util.fields:
		* JSONField and Base64Field now properly serialize to a JSON file,
		  so long as the patch at http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/9522
		  is applied.

		* Objects saved in the admin UI that have a Base64Field no longer
		  causes garbage in the field. The fields are now saved properly.
		  (Bug #918)

	* djblets.gravatars:
		* Added an "alt" attribute for the generated gravatar image, in order
		  to fix XHTML compliance.

	* djblets.datagrids:
		* Fixed some XHTML validation errors. Patch by Onkar Shinde.
		  (Bug #932)


version 0.5 alpha 3 (15-February-2009):
	* JavaScript Bugs Fixed:
		* Fixed some major performance issues in autoSizeTextArea.

		* Fixed a bug with Safari and inlineEditor where Safari would
		  sometimes crash due to autoSizeTextArea. We now just disable
		  the autoSizeTextArea functionality.

		* inlineEditor no longer allows startEdit to be called when editing
		  is already enabled.

	* New Features:
		* Added new set_etag, etag_if_none_match, etag_if_match functions
		  for working with ETags.

		* Added a new jQuery.fn.html() method that works around IE's broken
		  innerHTML implementation. innerHTML in IE would strip whitespace,
		  which was bad when inserting into <pre> and <textarea> tags.



version 0.5 alpha 2 (3-February-2009):
	* JavaScript:
		* We now include and require jQuery 1.3.1 and jQueyr-ui 1.6rc5.

		* Added support for starting an inlineEditor in the opened state,
		  and prevent animations when starting or forcing it to be open.

		* Disabled keypress propagation for inlineEditor. This fixes a bug
		  in Review Board's diff viewer (bug #838).

	* djblets.gravatars (new):
		* Added basic support for gravatars. This provides a {% gravatars %}
		  template tag for displaying a gravatar based on a User object.
		  See http://www.gravatar.com/ for more information on Gravatars.

	* djblets.util:
		* Added a {% include_as_string %} tag for including a template
		  as a JavaScript string.

		* Added the ability to generate media and AJAX serial numbers based
		  on the media files and template files. These can be appended to
		  the media and AJAX URLs which, in combination with aggressive
		  Expires headers, can drastically speed up load times of sites.

		  See djblets.util.context_processors and
		  djblets.util.misc.generate_cache_serials.

	* djblets.webapi:
		* Set the mime type for JSON responses to application/json,
		  except when responding to an upload, in which case text/plain
		  is used.

		* Fixed a bug where WebAPIResponse._get_content was called too
		  frequently and in some cases generated a 500 error.
